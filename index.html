		<section id="about">
			<div class="container">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
						<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">What We Do</h2>
						<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Hear our story and what we're seeking to achieve.</h3>
						<p class="text-muted">Throughout our lives there are not many things we can be certain of. Of course, there is Benjamin Franklin, who put it quite bluntly: the only things we can truly be certain of are death and taxes. At Peace Of Mind Training, we want to provide you with a sense of control in a world where there isn’t very much of it to go around. When an emergency occurs, there are two things that you have power over: the knowledge to act in a sensible, effective manner, and the confidence to put that reaction into motion. An example we like to think of is, why we get our children vaccinated. The more obvious reason we do this is to attempt to gain back some control from the uncertain nature of the world, in this case life-altering diseases. While this is the more obvious answer, there is another underlying reason that many people don’t realize: there are some of us who simply cannot get vaccinated. In this case, we vaccinate people so that the few can provide protection for not only themselves, but also so that the few can protect the many who are not able to protect themselves. Emergencies and viruses are actually quite similar in the sense that neither entity discriminates based on class, creed, or gender, and they certainly do not only rear their heads when those best equipped to mitigate the scenario are present. Throughout our society, we can see many examples of the few protecting the many, vaccinations being just one major example in today's world. Another example is the fact that only 2.4% of the people of the United States are trained to save a life, which is a bit of a worrying statistic. In other words, this means that in a room of 100 people, on average, there are only two people who know how to react when a life threatening situation arises.</p>
						<p class="text-muted">We live in the golden age of information, where being unprepared to handle a situation is a thing of the past. As human beings, we have the power to control what we do and do not know, as well as what we will and will not accept. Here is what we know: we know that as it stands today, the world is in desperate need for its citizens to gain the confidence and knowledge of how to act when a life threatening situation presents itself; what we don’t know yet is how we can fix this problem... until now. What is unacceptable is the fact that as it stands today, only a select few people have access to learn how to handle these dangerous situations, but at Peace Of Mind Training, we plan on changing that.</p>

We truly believe that it is time we all start taking care of each other, and that responsibility is on our shoulders for now, but soon it will be on your shoulders, and eventually your children’s.
